# Enhancing_Speech_Quality_Using_DL

### Problem Statement 

Speech recordings in real-world environments are frequently affected by background noise, overlapping voices, and low-quality audio. These factors degrade the clarity and intelligibility of speech, hindering the performance of speech-dependent applications like voice assistants, transcription systems, and teleconferencing tools. To address these challenges, this project aims to develop a machine learning-based system capable of enhancing speech quality by focusing on two key tasks: denoising and speech enhancement.
The system will effectively remove noise, aim to isolate individual speakers in multi-speaker scenarios, and improve the overall quality of the speech signal. This solution is expected to enable clearer communication in noisy environments and improve the functionality of applications requiring high-quality speech input.
